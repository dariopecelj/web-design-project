        "text":"Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, robotics) AI can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance, autonomous vehicles, and generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in the daily news and our daily lives.",

        "text":"Performance core numbers are not expected to rise this generation, with the top chips still sporting eight P cores. Efficiency core counts will likely stay the same at the original Arrow Lake launch, with up to 16 cores at the top end. However, there is talk of a mid-generation refresh, which could give some Arrow Lake chips as many as 32 E cores, though those won’t arrive until well into 2025. The new chips will have new core architectures, though. The Arrow Lake P cores will reportedly be based on the Lion Cove architecture, while the efficiency cores will use the Skymont architecture.",
